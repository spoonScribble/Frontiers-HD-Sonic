## HD Sonic V1.2
- COMPLETELY rebaked all ambient occlusion. No longer harsh, dark, or in the wrong places.
- General texture updates and fixes
- Sonic's skin hue has been changed very, very slightly (barely noticeable, in a good way)
- Baked curvature has now been added, the skin's subsurface scattering should look a bit better now
- Fixed a bug where Sonic's teeth and nose were sometimes included in the subsurface scattering
- Fixed a bug where Sonic's eye_prm was not properly adjusting the parallax effect
- Fixed a bug where Super Sonic's eyes had a visible seam

...plus some other things I can't quite remember. I lost sleep over this update. Didn't really expect the mod to get this much traction or this many eyes on it. I've never publically modded a game before, let alone made textures for a game (I make renders and such). A lot of things that should've been glaringly obvious, like not baking AO on non-static objects, didn't really occur to me. I'm not used to seeing my textures.. move? In realtime? So thank you for being patient with me. I'm trying my best.
